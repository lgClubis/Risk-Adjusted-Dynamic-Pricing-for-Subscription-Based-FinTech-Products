# Data

This project uses the **SaaS Subscription & Churn Analytics Dataset**, which is publicly available on Kaggle:

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rivalytics/saas-subscription-and-churn-analytics-dataset

## Data Usage

- The dataset is used **for educational and analytical purposes only**.
- The data is **not included in this repository** due to Kaggle's terms of use.
- All rights to the data belong to the original data provider.

## How to Obtain the Data

1. Create a (free) Kaggle account if you do not already have one.
2. Download the dataset from the link above.
3. Extract the files and place them into this `data/` directory.

The expected directory structure after downloading the data should look similar to:

data/
├── customers.csv
├── subscriptions.csv
├── usage.csv
├── billing.csv
└── churn.csv


*(Exact file names may differ depending on the dataset version.)*

## Notes

The dataset is **synthetic** and designed to simulate real-world SaaS subscription behavior, including customer churn, usage patterns, and billing dynamics.  
It serves as a realistic proxy for a **subscription-based FinTech product** in this project.
